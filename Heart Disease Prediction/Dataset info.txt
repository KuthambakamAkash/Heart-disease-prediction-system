Certainly! The Cleveland Clinic Heart Disease Dataset is a valuable resource for predicting coronary heart disease (CHD) by non-invasive means.

****************************************************************************************************************************
****************************************************************************************************************************
Context:

CHD involves the reduction of blood flow to the heart muscle due to the build-up of plaque in the arteries of the heart.
Invasive coronary angiography is the gold standard for diagnosing CHD, but it is costly and associated with morbidity and mortality.
Researchers aim to develop a non-invasive alternative to replace the current gold standard.
Dataset Information:
Observations: 303
Features: 13

****************************************************************************************************************
****************************************************************************************************************

Target Attribute: Presence or absence of coronary artery disease (CAD) based on invasive coronary angiogram results.
0: Absence of CHD
1-4: Presence of CHD
Features include:
Age: Age in years
Sex: 1 (male) or 0 (female)
Chest Pain Type (cp):
1: Typical angina
2: Atypical angina
3: Non-anginal pain
4: Asymptomatic
Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps): In mm Hg on admission to the hospital
Serum Cholesterol (chol): In mg/dl
Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs): > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
Resting Electrocardiographic Results (restecg):
0: Normal
1: ST-T wave abnormality
2: Probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy
Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalach)
Exercise-Induced Angina (exang): 1 (yes) or 0 (no)
ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest (oldpeak)
Target Variable:

Represents the presence or absence of CAD based on invasive coronary angiogram results.
Most research using this dataset focuses on distinguishing presence (values 1-4) from absence (value 0).
